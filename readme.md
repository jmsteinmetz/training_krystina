Couple of things to try:
- Create other types of chart (area, bar, pie, etc)
- Make 2 charts side by side
	hint: if you have trouble, include bootstrap and use scaffolding
- Change the way the charts look 
	- thickness of line, etc

Try some of the examples on their site and see if you cant get it working.
